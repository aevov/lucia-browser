# Lucia Browser: Hybrid Orchestration Engine (OSS Reference)

Developed by **WPWakanda LLC** (officially recognized since 2019).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lucia is the open-source community edition of the **Luci** browser. It is designed as a **Hybrid Orchestrator**, bridging the gap between traditional "Tabs-First" browsing and the infinite spatial mesh of the **Nara Engine**.

## 🚀 The Nara Advantage
Lucia is powered by the **Nara Engine**, the world's first Hyper-Orchestration browser engine. While it provides a familiar Chromium-like experience by default, it unlocks the following capabilities:

### 1. Hybrid UI Model
- **Standard Tabs**: Productive, familiar, and optimized for traditional web workflows.
- **Nara Mesh (Spatial Mode)**: Hit the toggle to zoom out into an infinite 3D spatial canvas where tabs become **WebsiteCards**.
- **Tab Promotion**: Promoted tabs become living entities in the spatial mesh, capable of clustering and neural linking.

### 2. Quantum Protocols
- Native support for `httq://` and `httqs://` via the Nara Orchestration backplane.
- QNS Decentralized Naming resolution.
- Tansu Relay support for anonymous, censor-proof transit.

### 3. Aevov Intelligence Core
- Built-in **Aevov 4.0** pattern recognition for proactive intent prediction.
- Local-first intelligence that evolves with your browsing without compromising privacy.
