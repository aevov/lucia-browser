# Lucia Browser: Architecture & Core Technologies

Lucia is not a traditional Chromium fork; it is a **Hybrid Orchestrator** built on top of the **Nara Engine**, a decentralization-first hyper-orchestration backplane.

## 1. The Nara Engine (Core Orchestrant)
The heart of Lucia is the **Nara Engine**, written in Rust. Unlike V8 or Blink, which focus on document rendering, Nara focuses on **State Orchestration**.

### ⚛️ Neural Patterns & ACL
Nara uses **ACL (Afolabi Computing Language)** as its native logic. ACL allows the engine to evaluate complex "neural resonance" patterns that determine how web content is displayed and synchronized across the mesh.

### 🚀 UOE (Universal Optimization Engine)
The **UOE** is responsible for real-time resource allocation. It uses cognitive load prediction (via Aevov AI) to determine which components of a page or spatial environment require the most bandwidth or compute, enabling a 33,333:1 theoretical data compression ratio.

## 2. Hybrid Orchestration Model
Lucia implements a unique dual-mode interface:

### 🏙️ Mode A: Unified Tabs (Traditional)
For standard browsing, Lucia presents a familiar tabbed interface. In this mode:
- Each tab is an isolated **NaraViewport**.
- The engine prioritizes linear document reading and standard JS execution.
- Performance is tuned for low latency and high compatibility with Gen3 web protocols.

### 🌌 Mode B: Nara Spatial Mesh (Spatial Canvas)
With a single click, Lucia enters the **Infinite Spatial Canvas**. Here:
- Tabs are "unpinned" and become **WebsiteCards** in a 3D grid.
- Users can cluster related cards together, forming "Neural Links" that synchronize state between disparate domains.
- The canvas is backed by the **QuantumFS** mesh storage, meaning your spatial layout persists across all your devices and identities.

## 3. Protocol Stack
Lucia supports the next generation of decentralized communication:

- **HTTQ (Hyper-Text Transport Quantum)**: A p2p protocol that uses quantum-resistant encryption and neural routing via Tansu Relays.
- **QNS (Quantum Name System)**: A decentralized DNS alternative where `.q` domains (e.g., `wakanda.q`) are resolved via the Aevov Mesh Orbitals.
- **AevIP**: The underlying mesh networking layer that enables anonymous, censor-proof data transit.

## 4. Why This Matters
Traditional browsers treat the web as a collection of silos. Lucia treats the web as a **Collaborative Cognitive Mesh**. By combining the familiarity of a tabbed browser with the power of a spatial engine, we are enabling the transition to **Web 4.0**.
